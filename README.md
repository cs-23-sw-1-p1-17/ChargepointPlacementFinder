# Chargepoint Placement Finder
This project takes focuses on the placement of chargers for electric vehicles.
This is to be done by developing a program that can map out the ideal placements of the chargers.

## Representing stops and roads with graphs
The routes between stops are represented using edges.
Each edge contains a traffic coefficient (what degree daily traffic affects this route). Furthermore, an edge contains a distance/time coefficient.
